# CPE400Project
# Names: Nick Mason, Nick Thom, Sybille Horcholle
# Project(4): Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty networks. 
# The project will include the creation of a mesh network with nodes and links.  Nodes and links can fail during the process of communication within the network.  The code will handle node and link failure, with early detection, in order to avoid future node and link failure as a result of the first faulty link between nodes.
